- This is my project for Code Louisville Front-End Web Development. For my project I set out to create a base template site for me to play with. With this in mind I wanted to share some links to logins for access to my hosted cloud service as well as Ombi for my family to access whenever they have requests or want to share something with me or archive for themselves. Past that it will serve as a jumping off point if I ever decide to pursue a job as a front end developer. The other positive of this project for me was to get more familiar with what all is invovled with the front end development of a site so I can better articulate my ideas with co-workers. 
 
- I have included the Flexbox CSS Feature
- I have included a Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button. (REDRUM button)
- I have included a navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes.
- I have also included a CSS animation in an image on the site. (Placeholder Image horror flicker type effect)
- I have included a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation and displays the result on your page (Roll 20 button)
